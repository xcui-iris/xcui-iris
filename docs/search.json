Central to my work is my job market paper, “E-Verify and the Employment of Undocumented Immigrants: Political Posturing vs. Reality.” This study examines the impact of E-Verify mandates across various U.S. states. Our analysis reveals significant variation in their effectiveness, driven by differences in policy design and enforcement. By unraveling the complexities of immigration policy and its tangible effects on labor market outcomes, this research offers crucial insights for policymakers and stakeholders, particularly in sectors like agriculture, which heavily rely on undocumented workers.\nThrough my extension work, I have had the privilege of directly engaging with farmers and agricultural communities, teaching farm management concepts, and assisting them with business planning and financial analysis. I pioneered the development of extension materials on industrial hemp, creating a new program that directly addressed the urgent needs of stakeholders. The hemp budgeting tools and producer surveys I developed have been well-received, helping producers make informed decisions. Additionally, I developed and led an innovative training program on farm safety, with a specific focus on the health risk management aspect for tobacco farm workers. I successfully secured a USDA-NIFA grant to implement the project, with the support of the industry and a team of extension agents. This program has since gained national recognition for its significant impact. In terms of curriculum development, I also initiated the “7 $ecrets for Effective Farmers” webinar series, designed to empower small and beginning farmers with practical tools for success.\nI approach education with the same hands-on, problem-solving focus that I bring to my research and extension. I am dedicated to making complex economic concepts accessible and relevant, preparing students to become informed and impactful contributors to the agricultural industry. Having spent years teaching adults, I understand the unique needs and learning styles of adult learners. I recognize that adult students often bring diverse experiences and practical knowledge to the classroom, which can be a powerful asset in the learning process. By integrating real-world examples, I make my classes more applied and relevant, ensuring that students can directly connect theory with practice.\nI am actively involved in research that explores the intersection of economics, technology, and sustainability in agriculture. On this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including peer-reviewed journal articles, extension publications, market reports, and conference presentations, along with updates on my ongoing projects.\nAs I approach the completion of my PhD in the summer of 2025, I am actively seeking new opportunities in industry, academic institutions, and public entities. If you’re interested in discussing potential roles or collaborations, please feel free to reach out.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages.

This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
