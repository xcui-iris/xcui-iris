Central to my work is my job market paper, “Political Posturing vs. Reality: E-Verify and the Employment of Undocumented Immigrants.” This study examines the impact of E-Verify mandates across various U.S. states. These laws aim to reduce unauthorized employment, yet our analysis reveals significant variations in their outcomes. We discuss the factors driving these variations, focusing on the key differences in political intentions and policy design. The study reveals that policymakers often pursue multiple objectives, aiming to advance their political agendas while also minimizing the impact of immigration policies on key sectors such as agriculture.\nThrough my extension work, I have had the privilege of directly engaging with farmers and agricultural communities, teaching farm management concepts, and assisting them with business planning and financial analysis. I pioneered the development of extension materials on industrial hemp, creating a new program that directly addressed the urgent needs of stakeholders. The hemp budgeting tools and producer surveys I developed have been well-received, helping producers make informed decisions. Additionally, I developed and led an innovative training program on farm safety, with a specific focus on the health risk management aspect for tobacco farm workers. I successfully secured a USDA-NIFA grant to implement the project, with the support of the industry and a team of extension agents. This program has since gained national recognition for its significant impact. In terms of curriculum development, I also initiated the “7 Secrets for Effective Farmers” webinar series, designed to empower small and beginning farmers with practical tools for success.\nI approach education with the same hands-on, problem-solving focus that I bring to my research and extension. I am dedicated to making complex economic concepts accessible and relevant, preparing students to become informed and impactful contributors to the agricultural industry. Having spent years teaching adults, I understand the unique needs and learning styles of adult learners. I recognize that adult students often bring diverse experiences and practical knowledge to the classroom, which can be a powerful asset in the learning process. By integrating real-world examples, I make my classes more applied and relevant, ensuring that students can directly connect theory with practice.\nI am actively involved in research that explores the intersection of economics, technology, and sustainability in agriculture. On this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including peer-reviewed journal articles, extension publications, market reports, and conference presentations, along with updates on my ongoing projects.\nAs I approach the completion of my PhD in the summer of 2025, I am actively seeking new opportunities in industry, academic institutions, and public entities. If you’re interested in discussing potential roles or collaborations, please feel free to reach out."

    "text": "Male Dominance in the Hiring of Foreign Guest Workers: Controversy and Spillover Effects\n\nDue to labor shortages and tightening immigration policies, the foreign guest workers program, also known as H-2A, has seen rapid growth. A rising concern within the H-2A program is its hiring practices, which are observed to predominantly recruit male workers. This imbalance has reportedly led to the layoffs of domestic female workers in some regions, highlighting potential gender disparities. This research paper investigates the potential spillover effects of the H-2A program’s controversial hiring practices on the domestic agricultural labor market."
