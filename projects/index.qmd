The adoption of E-Verify mandates by various U.S. states aims
to reduce unauthorized employment, yet our analysis reveals significant variations in their outcomes, using a synthetic control approach. We discuss the factors driving these variations, focusing on the key differences in political intentions and policy design. The study reveals that policymakers often pursue multiple objectives, aiming to
advance their political agendas while also minimizing the impact of immigration policies on key sectors. These findings are particularly important for stakeholders in industries like agriculture, which often rely on undocumented workers.

Due to labor shortages and tightening immigration policies, the foreign guest workers program, also known as H-2A, has seen rapid growth. A rising concern within the H-2A program is its hiring practices, which are observed to predominantly recruit male workers. This imbalance has reportedly led to the layoffs of domestic female workers in some regions, highlighting potential gender disparities. This research paper investigates the potential spillover effects of the H-2A programâ€™s controversial hiring practices on the domestic agricultural labor market.
